# Tensor — Key Interview Questions and Answers

| # | Category | Question | Short Answer Key Points |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Definition | What is a Tensor in the context of machine learning? | Multi-dimensional array (N-dimensional) used as the fundamental data structure for all data and parameters in deep learning. |
| 2 | Hierarchy | How is a Tensor a generalization of a scalar, vector, and matrix? | Scalar is Rank-0, Vector is Rank-1, Matrix is Rank-2. A tensor is any array with Rank ≥ 0. |
| 3 | Properties | What are the Rank and Shape of a tensor? | Rank is the number of dimensions/axes. Shape is the tuple specifying the size along each dimension. |
| 4 | Necessity | Why are Tensors necessary in Deep Learning, not just standard arrays? | They are optimized for efficient numerical computation and seamlessly integrate with GPU/TPU for massive parallelism. |
| 5 | Hardware | How do Tensors enable parallelism in deep learning? | Tensor operations are optimized for SIMD architectures (like GPUs/TPUs), allowing simultaneous arithmetic across many elements. |
| 6 | Role (FWD) | Explain the role of Tensors in the Forward Pass. | Input data and weights (both tensors) undergo a series of tensor operations (matrix multiplication, convolution) to produce an output tensor. |
| 7 | Role (BWD) | Explain the role of Tensors in the Backward Pass (Backpropagation). | The gradients of the loss with respect to the weights are calculated and stored as tensors, used to update the weight tensors. |
| 8 | Data Example | Give a real-world example of a Rank-4 tensor and its dimensions. | A batch of color images: (Batch Size, Height, Width, Color Channels). |
| 9 | Frameworks | Name the two most popular Deep Learning frameworks built around the Tensor data structure. | TensorFlow and PyTorch. |
| 10 | Broadcasting | Explain the concept of Broadcasting in tensor operations. | A mechanism allowing arithmetic on tensors of different shapes by automatically stretching the smaller tensor to match the larger one's shape. |
| 11 | Operation | What is the difference between element-wise operations and dot product operations? | Element-wise applies a function to each element independently (e.g., addition, ReLU). Dot Product (or matrix multiplication) involves summing products over axes. |
| 12 | Gradients | What is the purpose of the `requires_grad=True` attribute (in PyTorch)? | It signals the Autograd system to track all operations on the tensor to enable automatic gradient calculation during the backward pass. |
| 13 | Data Type | Why is the float32 dtype common for tensors in deep learning? | It balances precision with memory/computational efficiency, and GPUs are often optimized for float32. |
| 14 | Special Tensor | What is a Sparse Tensor, and when is it used? | A tensor that only stores non-zero values and their indices, used to efficiently represent data with many zero elements (e.g., in recommendation systems). |
| 15 | Alternatives | What is the closest functional alternative to a tensor for numerical computation? | NumPy Arrays (`numpy.ndarray`), though they lack built-in GPU acceleration and gradient tracking. |
| 16 | Operation | What does it mean to flatten a tensor, and when is it necessary? | Converting a higher-rank tensor into a Rank-1 tensor (a vector). Necessary when moving data from convolutional/pooling layers to a fully connected (dense) layer. |
| 17 | Memory | How do tensors benefit memory usage and management? | They allow for contiguous memory allocation, which improves data access speed and overall computational efficiency. |
| 18 | Special Tensor | What is a Quantized Tensor? | A tensor whose elements are stored using lower precision (e.g., 8-bit integers) to reduce model size and accelerate inference on edge devices. |
| 19 | Concept | What is the purpose of Tensor Slicing? | Selecting a subset of elements from a tensor along specific axes using index notation for focused analysis or manipulation. |
| 20 | Architecture | How are the weights of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) kernel represented as a tensor? | As a Rank-4 tensor: (Output Channels, Input Channels, Kernel Height, Kernel Width). |
